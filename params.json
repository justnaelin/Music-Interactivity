Users can click on tiles to play snippets of the song corresponding with that tile. This works by pushing a song into an array and associating each index of the array with a tile in the pattern. Other functionality include trailing through the song in anyway the user pleases with the arrow keys, selecting a tile and playing the song from that bar, and incrementing and decrementing the beats to be skipped. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nNaelin Aquino (@justnaelin) and Ana Perez (@anartsoccer6)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
